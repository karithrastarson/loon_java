Loon purpose is to provide wireless network to remote areas through of a set of high altitude balloon equipped with advanced sophisticated wireless transceivers to connect people globally. This technology could allow developing countries to avoid the using of expensive underground infrastructure.},

@article{Swinbank,
abstract = {The aim of the UARS (Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite) Reference Atmosphere Project (URAP) is to provide a comprehensive zonal mean reference description of the stratosphere using measurements from instruments on board the UARS. A data set has been produced which describes the monthly zonal-mean zonal winds from the surface to the upper mesosphere. Wind measurements from the High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) were combined with results from The Met. Office stratospheric data assimilation system. Balanced winds derived from the URAP temperature data set were used to bridge the gap between the stratospheric winds and HRDI mesospheric winds. INTRODUCTION This paper describes the compilation of a monthly wind data set from measurements by the HRDI instrument on board UARS and stratospheric assimilation data from The Met. Office. The initial impetus for the compilation of this data set was the UARS Reference Atmosphere Project (Remedios et al, 2000), which is a compilation of monthly stratospheric data focused on a particular baseline year (April 1992 to March 1993). The data set will also form a part of the SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate) reference climatology. The data set comprises zonal-mean zonal wind data from the earth's surface to the upper mesosphere every month for a period of about 8 years starting from the launch of UARS. The wind data are stored on a pressure-latitude grid; the pressures are the UARS standard pressure levels (p i = 1000hPa.10},

@article{Moon2009,
abstract = {This paper describes the design, tuning, and evaluation of a full-range adaptive cruise control (ACC) system with collision avoidance (CA). The control scheme is designed to improve drivers' comfort during normal, safe-driving situations and to completely avoid rear-end collision in vehicle-following situations. Driving situations are divided into safe, warning, and dangerous modes. Three different control strategies have been proposed, depending on the driving situation. The driving situations are determined using a non-dimensional warning index and the time-to-collision (TTC). The control parameters of the proposed ACC/CA system are tuned by a confusion-matrix method using manual-driving data in no-crashing driving situations. The vehicle-following characteristics of the subject vehicle were compared to real-world, manual-driving data. Finally, the ACC/CA system was also implemented in a real vehicle and tested in both safe-traffic and severe-braking situations. It is shown that the proposed control strategy can provide natural following performance that is similar to human manual-driving in both high-speed driving and low-speed stop-and-go situations. Furthermore, it can prevent the vehicle-to-vehicle distance from dropping to an unsafe level in a variety of driving conditions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of placing n points, each one inside its own, prespecified disk, with the objective of maximizing the distance between the closest pair of them. The disks can overlap and have different sizes. The problem is NP-hard and does not admit a PTAS. In the L∞ metric, we give a 2-approximation algorithm running in O (n sqrt(n) log2 n) time. In the L2 metric, we give a quadratic time algorithm that gives an frac(8, 3)-approximation in general, and a ∼2.2393-approximation when all the disks are congruent. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.
