The model is the structure and relationship between all objects. It is modifiable in some ways to be able to measure and compare performance of different algorithms. The parameters that should be adjusted before simulation are the following:

\begin{description}
\item[WORLD\_SIZE:] The integer dimension of the grid that represents the earth. This number greatly affects the run time of the model as well as accuracy. 
\item[NUMBER\_OF\_BALLOONS:] The number of balloons in the model. This variable is usually set to the number of cells in the earth grid, i.e WORLD\_SIZE$^2$.This means that best case scenario the coverage is 100\% and all the balloons are perfectly spread.
\item[VERTICAL\_SPEED:] The speed of the balloon in directions up and down. This number will be added/subtracted from the balloon's altitude each step, until its motion in that direction is stopped.
\item[NUMBER\_OF\_STEPS:] How many steps the simulation should run. This number should be as big as possible to properly model the behaviour of the ecosystem. 
\item[NUMBER\_OF\_CURRENTS:] The number of wind layers, or wind currents, in the system. The more layers there is to choose from the more accurate direction the balloon should be able to choose from.
\item[MIN/MAX\_ALTITUDE:] Numbers used to divide the layers. The total distance between MIN and MAX is divided equally between all the layers in the model. This is used to determine whether a balloon has reached a new wind layer. The units are abstract but should be taken into consideration when choosing vertical speed. The vertical speed corresponds to the units in this MIN/MAX scale.
\end{description}

The model and simulation go hand in hand. When all objects have been created and configured, the simulation is run. 

The simulation moves all balloons according to the established stratosphere. Each step of the simulation the following process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Apply decisions: All balloons decide, using the control algorithm, whether they should start moving up or down or stay in the current altitude. 
    \item Apply currents: When the decision has been made, all the balloons are moved according to the wind layer they are currently located in. Furthermore they are moved up or down according to the model parameter for vertical speed. 
    \item Update statistics: The statistics of the simulation are gathered on the fly so after each iteration the data is re-evaluated and stored for further analysis.
\end{enumerate}
