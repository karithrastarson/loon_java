The loon project aims to launch thousands of balloons, each carrying expensive equipment and weighing little over 200 kilograms\footnote{FACT CHECK}. It would be foolish to attempt such a thing before making sure that the end goal is plausible, if not definitely possible. This can be done relatively cheaply using computer simulations, which is exactly the aim of this project. Even though the world has been simplified significantly and many laws of physics overlooked, the simulation should give a good idea as to whether this idea is good or poor. Arguments are provided for all assumptions made during the modelling and their implications.
