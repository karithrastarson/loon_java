This project explores Google's endeavours to launch balloons to the stratosphere to supply rural areas with an Internet connection. A model is constructed to simulate the movement of the balloons and a framework is created for further development of the control algorithm that dictates whether a balloon should move to a new wind layer or not. Several algorithms are created and compared. The result is a JAVA tool that can be further built upon.
